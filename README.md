# robot-killer
Basic example implementation for Google invisible recaptcha.  CORS needs to be enabled in your browser for this example to work.

-- The invisible recaptcha uses a risk analysis engine to determine the likelihood of a user being a robot.
-- If it decides there is a potential bot accessing the page the user will be forced to do a normal picture or audio captcha.
-- There are three different security settings under the advanced settings on the page above, this controls how often a user is actually prompted to solve a captcha.
-- The recaptcha is invoked when the user clicks the submit button, but this can also be done through a javascript API call.
-- Normally recaptcha has limited support for users without javascript enabled, invisible recaptcha has no support for this.
-- Keys can be generated and security level changed here:
